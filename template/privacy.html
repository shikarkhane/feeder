<h3 id="section1">Information Collection and Use</h3>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p class="tip">
  <span class="tip">Tip</span> We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Information Collected Upon Registration:</b> When you create or reconfigure a tipoff account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.</p>

<p><b>Additional Information:</b> You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a picture. You may provide information to customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may use your <a href="/we/settings/">account settings</a> to unsubscribe from notifications from tipoff.  You may also unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website.  We may use your contact information to help others find your tipoff account, including through third-party services and client applications. Your <a href="/we/settings/">privacy settings</a> control whether others can find you by your email address or cell phone number. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find tipoff users you know.  We may later suggest people to follow on tipoff based on your imported address book contacts, which you can delete from tipoff at any time.  If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.  If you connect your tipoff account to your account on another service in order to cross-post between tipoff and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize.  This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from tipoff within a few weeks of your disconnecting from tipoff your account on the other service.  Learn more <a href="/we/help/">here</a>. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:10px"><b>tipoffs, Following, Lists and other Public Information:</b> Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you tipoff and the metadata provided with tipoffs, such as when you tipoffed, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the tipoffs you mark as favorites or Re-tipoff, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from tipoff, but we generally give you <a href="/we/settings/">settings</a> to make the information more private if you want. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your public user profile information and public tipoffs may be searchable by search engines and are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to a wide range of users and services, with one example being the United States Library of Congress, which archives tipoffs for historical purposes. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>

<p><b>Location Information:</b> You may choose to publish your location in your tipoffs and in your tipoff profile.  You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on tipoff.io or enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You can set your tipoff location preferences in your <a href="/we/settings/">account settings</a> and learn more about this feature. Learn how to set your mobile location preferences <a href="/we/help/">here</a>. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as tipoff with your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow.</p>

<p><b>Links:</b> tipoff may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>

<p><b>Cookies:</b> Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. tipoff may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies <a href="/we/help/">here</a>.</p>

<p><b id="widget-jump">Log Data:</b> Our servers automatically record information ("<strong>Log Data</strong>") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information.  We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your tipoff account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a tipoff button or widget.  tipoff uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them.  If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>

<p><b>Widget Data:</b>  We may tailor content for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate tipoff buttons or widgets.  When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data, including the web page you visited and a cookie that identifies your browser ("<strong>Widget Data</strong>").  After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week.  While we have the Widget Data, we may use it to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow on tipoff.  Tailored content is stored with only your browser cookie ID and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit information.  This feature is optional and not yet available to all users.  If you want, you can suspend it or turn it off, which removes from your browser the unique cookie that enables the feature.  Learn more about the feature <a href="/we/help/">here</a>. For tipoffs, Log Data, and other information that we receive from interactions with tipoff buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>Third-Parties:</b> tipoff uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure ad quality and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in.  Learn more about this setting and your additional Do Not Track browser option <a href="/we/help/">here</a>.</p>
